# NOTE
All steps below are to aid in forming your own images. The names/values change depending on when the note was added. Software version will change, names should be your own, etc.

## Software Environment/Dependencies
- Git: [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- Docker/Docker Desktop: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Prerequisites
- Have your own GitHub account and Docker account. [References above]

## Overview
The following example is to be run on your own laptop. If a server is used, we need to vary the ports to prevent port conflicts. The point is to develop an understanding of Docker, not create a usable product. The author points out that users would pull the official Tomcat image rather than making one themselves.

## Steps

### 1. Download Files
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leefrankpierce/docker_training
```

- Cd into the cloned repo and find the Dockerfile, update to your usage. 
- Update the Node JS for your usage.

### 2. docker build
- Please change to your own name, the period at the end is important
- "docker build", Cleanup "--t", Name the image "-t", look in the current dir for a Dockerfile "."

```bash
docker build --rm -t centos-tomcat-leedogs:v2.1 . 
```

### 3. Run the image in the local Docker environment (desktop) 
- "docker run", name the container "--name", create a terminal "-it", map ports from laptop to into Docker "-dp", image to run

```bash
docker run --name dog -it -dp 8888:8080 centos-tomcat-leedogs:v2.1  
```

```bash
[http://localhost:8888/leeJS/](http://localhost:8888/leeJS/)
```

- or if running from a server
  
```bash
[http://server_IP:8888/leeJS/](http://server_IP:8888/leeJS/)
```

# To log into the running container.
```bash
docker attach dog
```

# Docker Utils

- List the docker containers
```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Stopping a specific container based on ID
```bash
docker stop b461816a7b69
```

- removing/cleaning up container usage:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

- Upload to dockerhub
- determine what images are local to your docker environment.
- The author finds the column names confusing, but just roll with it.

```bash
docker image ls
```
```
REPOSITORY              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

ubuntu-tomcat-leedogs   V1.1      ce02eec7376d   8 minutes ago   680MB
```

- Log into Docker hub. This connection remains for your session.
- Expectations = you are logging into your own docker account.
```bash
docker login 
```

- Tag or alias the image pointing to the dockerhub repo. Docker commands presume dockerhub. 
- The idea is to make a "tag" that tells dockerhub were to place the image.
- This should include your personal repo and whatever you want to call your image
- docker image tag, "name found in above ls command", "dockerhub repository name/", image name with version. 

```bash
docker image tag ubuntu-tomcat-leedogs:V1.1 leefrankpierce/leedogs:40
```
```bash
docker image ls
```

- See the new tag local to your docker environment.
- Push the image to dockerhub
- docker image push "name you created when making the tag"

```bash
docker image push leefrankpierce/leedogs:40
```
